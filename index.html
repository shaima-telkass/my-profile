    <h1>Hello I'm Shaïma </h1>
     <img src="images/profile.jpg"  class="img-circle img-bordered" width="100px" alt="Shaïma Telkass">
      <p>
    	My name is Shaïma and I'm 20 years old. I currently study at ESSEC GBBA as a 1st year student. 
      </p>

    <h2>Who am I ? My background </h2>
      <p> 
     	I'm from Orléans, little city known for the famous Joan of Arc. I graduated in 2018 and recieved a scientific baccalauréat européenne section with 18,2/20 and the Jury's Congratulations. I studied health sciences for two years but I realized it wasn't where I belonged. After reflecting on my skills and my general sense of ambition I decided to do Business instead.

	 <h2>Do I really look like someone who have free time? </h2>
      <p>
        I have many hobbies. I like to laugh, it's an activity I do every day as much as possible. I love bargain-hunting for furniture and clothes, going to flea markets and visiting churches! Most of all, I love spending time with my friends and family. (and I love coding know)

	<h2>Because I'm a passionate girl</h2>
      <p>
       Reading a good book or painting can make me lose all sense of time. I love all forms of art but particularly painting, sculpture and music. I am passionate about Henri Matisse, he is my favourite artist.

	<h2>Let's talk about future... </h2>
      <p>
       I don't aspire to have a traditional career, I would like to work independently and have a job that is out of the ordinary. However, I must admit that if I could become a great artist recognised by my peers, I would be the happiest woman on earth.
